:summary: Bazel's hermetic Zipper tool

We use `Bazel`_ at work to build large projects.
It's scalable and powerfulâ€”and difficult and complicated.

A colleague was trying to create a zipfile in Bazel.
Initially, they used the `Info-ZIP`_ ``zip`` tool.
Another colleague pointed out that Bazel has its own zipper_ tool.

Apparently, the classic ``zip`` tool
generates slightly different files each time it's run,
while ``zipper`` is hermetic_ and generates identical files.

    $ sha256sum z*.zip

    a93b6e24bcdcc399c90921920dfc09c6cf85bc11ab4652318ef1ce267b8b68be  z3.zip
    a93b6e24bcdcc399c90921920dfc09c6cf85bc11ab4652318ef1ce267b8b68be  z4.zip

``z1.zip`` and ``z2.zip`` were created with ``zip``,
while ``z{3,4}.zip`` were created with ``zipper``.
They all have identical contents
but ``zip`` creates slightly different files.

::

    $ cmp -l z{1,2}.zip
     2337 114 301
     2338   6  20
     2339 235 246
    17709 357 301
    17710 377  20
    17711 231 246
    18186  23 301
    18187 123  20
    18188 243 246

It turns out that `Bazel isn't always hermetic`_.
